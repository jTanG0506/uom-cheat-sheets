		\textbf{\textsc{1 Rings}}
	\end{center}
	A \textbf{ring} is a set $R$ and two binary operations, written $+ \, \text{and} \, \times$, on R which satisfies the following conditions:\\
	(R1) $\langle R, + \rangle$ is an abelian group with identity 0\\
	(R2) $\times$ is associative\\
	(R3) $\times$ is distributive over $+$\\
	(R4) there exists an element $1 \in R$, different from 0, that is an identity for $\times$\\
	
	\noindent
	Let $R$ be a ring and $S \subseteq R$. Then $S$ is a \textbf{subring} of R if it is a ring in its own right with respect to the same addition and multiplication as in $R$ and $S$ contains $1_R$.\\
	
	\noindent
	\textbf{Subring Test}: Let $R$ be a ring and $S \subseteq R$, then $S$ is a subring of $R$, iff:\\
	$(i) \, 1 \in S$\\
	$(ii) \, r + s, r \times s \in S$, for all $r, s \in S$\\
	$(iii) \, -r \in S$ for all $r \in S$\\
	
	\noindent
	Let R be a ring. The \textbf{ring of polynomials} $R[X]$ in the indeterminate $X$ is defined as follows:\\
	\textbf{Elements}: formal linear combinations of the form $\sum_{i \geq 0}a_iX^i$ with $a_i \in R$ for $i = 0, 1, \dots$\\
	\textbf{Equality}: $\sum_{i \geq 0}a_iX^i = \sum_{i \geq 0}b_iX^i \iff a_i = b_i$ for all $i \geq 0$\\
	\textbf{Addition}: $\sum_{i \geq 0}a_iX^i + \sum_{i \geq 0}b_iX^i = \sum_{i \geq 0}(a_i + b_i)X^i$\\
	\textbf{Multiplication}: $(\sum_{i \geq 0}a_iX^i)(\sum_{i \geq 0}b_iX^i) = \sum_{k \geq 0}(\sum_{i + j = k}a_ib_j)X^k$\\
	\textbf{Zero element} is $\sum_{i \geq 0}0X^i = 0$ and the \textbf{one} is $1X^0 + \sum_{i \geq 1}0X^i = 1$\\
	
	\noindent
	For a polynomial $f = \sum_{i \geq 0}a_iX^i$, we define the \textbf{degree} of $f$, denoted $deg(f)$, to be the largest $i$ such that $a_i \neq 0$ and we let $deg(f) = -\infty$ if $f = 0$.

	\end{center}
	The \textbf{characteristic}, $char(R)$, of a ring $R$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that $n \cdot 1 = 0$. If there is no such $n$, then the characteristic of $R$ is defined to be 0.\\
	
	\noindent
	A non-zero element $r \in R$ is a \textbf{zero-divisor} if there is a non-zero element $s \in R$ with $rs = 0$ or $sr = 0$.\\
	
	\noindent
	The ring $R$ is a \textbf{domain} if, for all $r, s \in R$, $rs = 0 \implies r = 0$ or $s = 0$, so a domain is a ring with \textbf{no} zero-divisors. A commutative domain is called an \textbf{integral domain}.\\
	
	\noindent
	A \textbf{division ring} is a ring in which every non-zero element has a right inverse and a left inverse. In this case, these inverses are the same. We write $r^{-1}$ for this \textbf{inverse} of $r$ and say that $r$ is \textbf{invertible} or that $r$ is a \textbf{unit}. A \textbf{field} is a commutative division ring.\\
	
	\noindent
	An element $r$ of a ring $R$ is \textbf{nilpotent} if there is some integer $n \geq 1$ with $r^n = 0$ and the least such $n$ is the \textbf{index of nilpotence} of r. An element $r \in R$ is \textbf{idempotent} if $r^2 = r$ - and 0 and 1 are idempotent in any ring.

		\textbf{\textsc{3 Isomorphisms, Homomorphisms and Ideals}}
	\end{center}
	If $R$ and $S$ are rings then an \textbf{isomorphism} from $R$ to $S$ is a \textbf{bijection} $\theta: R \rightarrow S$ such that, for all $r, r' \in R$:\\
	$$\theta(r + r') = \theta(r) + \theta(r') \quad \text{and} \quad \theta(r \times r') = \theta(r) \times \theta(r')$$
	If $\theta$ is an isomorphism from $R$ to $S$, then we write $\theta: R \simeq S$. We say that $R$ and $S$ are \textbf{isomorphic}, and write $R \simeq S$, if there is an isomorphism from $R$ to $S$.\\
	
	\noindent
	If $R$ and $S$ are rings then a \textbf{homomorphism} from $R$ to $S$ is a map $\theta: R \rightarrow S$ such that, for all $r, r' \in R$:
	$$\theta(r + r') = \theta(r) + \theta(r') \quad and \quad \theta(r \times r') = \theta(r) \times \theta(r') \quad and \quad \theta(1_R) = 1_S$$
	
	\noindent
	An \textbf{embedding}, or \textbf{monomorphism}, is an injective homomorphism.\\
	
	\noindent
	If $\theta: R \rightarrow S$ is a homomorphism of rings then the \textbf{kernel} of $\theta$, $ker(\theta)$, is the set $\{r \in R \, \vert \, \theta(r) = 0\}$.\\
	
	\noindent
	An \textbf{automorphism} of a ring is an isomorphism from the ring to itself.\\
	
	\noindent
	An \textbf{ideal} of a ring R is a subset $I \subseteq R$ such that:
	$$0 \in I \quad \text{and} \quad a + b \in I, \; \text{for all} \; a, b \in I \quad \text{and} \quad ar \in I \; \text{and} \; ra \in I \; \text{for all} \; a \in I \; \text{and for all} \; r \in R$$
	
	\noindent
	We write $I \triangleleft R$ to mean that $I$ is an ideal of $R$.\\
	
	\noindent
	If $a \in R$ then $\{r_1as_1 + \cdots + r_nas_n \; \vert \; n \geq 1, r_i, s_i \in R\}$ is an ideal which contains $a$ and is the smallest ideal of $R$ containing $a$. It is called the \textbf{principal ideal generated by} $a$ and is denoted $\langle a \rangle$. If $R$ is commutative, then its description simplifies: $\langle a \rangle = \{ar \; \vert \; r \in R\}$. A \textbf{principal} ideal is one which can be generated by a single element.\\
	
	\noindent
	In every ring $\langle 0 \rangle = \{ 0 \}$ is the smallest ideal and is called the \textbf{trivial ideal}.\\
	In every ring $\langle 1 \rangle = R$ is the largest ideal and every other ideal is referred to as a \textbf{proper ideal}.\\
	
	\noindent
	The more general notion of \textbf{right ideal} is defined as for ideal but with the third condition replaced by the weaker condition: $a \in I$ and $r \in R$ implies $ar \in I$. Then, if $a \in R$, the \textbf{principal right ideal generated by} $a \in R$ is defined to be the set $\{ar \; \vert \; r \in R\}$ and is denoted $aR$.
